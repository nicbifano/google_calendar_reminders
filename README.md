Make a Copy
From the File menu, choose Make a copy to save your own editable version in Google Drive.

Set Up Triggers
Once your copy is open:

Click the Create Triggers button in the sheet.

Confirm Authorization
The first time you run the trigger setup, Google will prompt for authorization â€” grant permissions so the script can access your Calendar and Gmail.

This will automatically add the time-based triggers that run every few minutes to check your Google Calendar and send reminder emails.
